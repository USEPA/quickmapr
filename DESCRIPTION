Description: While analyzing geospatial data, easy visualization is often needed
  that allows for quick plotting, and simple, but easy interactivity.
  Additionally, visualizing geospatial data in projected coordinates is also
  desirable.  The 'quickmapr' package provides a simple method to visualize 'sp'
  and 'raster' objects, allows for basic zooming, panning, identifying, and
  labeling of spatial objects, and does not require that the data be in
  geographic coordinates.
