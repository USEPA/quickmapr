Description: Visualizing spatial data in R has received a lot of attention and
    their are many packages to provide production quality maps and many
    packages that offer interactivity (zoom, pan, and identify) .  To do this,
    these packages utilize javascript and/or require data to be in a specific
    projection thus requiring several additional steps to produce a map.
    During the analytical process, however, a quick and easy visualization is
    needed that allows for quick plotting, and simple, but easy interactivity.
    \code{quickmapr} fills this gap by providing a simple method to visualize
    sp and raster objects as well as allow for basic zooming, panning and
    identifying of spatial objects.
Imports:
    sp,
    rgdal,
    raster,
    zoom,
    rgeos
Suggests:
    knitr
VignetteBuilder: knitr
