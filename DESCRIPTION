Description: Visualizing spatial data in R has received a lot of attention and
    their are many packages to provide production quality maps and offer 
    interactivity (zoom, pan, and identify) .  To do this,these packages 
    utilize javascript and/or require data to be in geographic coordinates, 
    thus requiring several additional steps to produce a map. During the 
    analytical process, however, a quick and easy visualization is often 
    needed that allows for quick plotting, and simple, but easy interactivity.
    \code{quickmapr} fills this gap by providing a simple method to visualize
    sp and raster objects as well as allow for basic zooming, panning and
    identifying of spatial objects.
Depends: R (>= 2.10)
Imports:
    rgeos,
    sp,
    rgdal
Suggests:
    raster
